first review: The designed solution does not work for case of Memory limit is smaller that filesize; the sorting algorithm is not efficient enough, a lot of duplicated code and generally the code is too far from "ready to use".


build file:
- g++ -o main main.cpp

run file: 
- ./main

command:
- input: to input path of your file and sort
- setmaxmemery: to set max memory you want to use to sort
- break: to end the program
